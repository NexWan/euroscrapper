# EuroScrapper

This is a simple webscrapper that uses curl and python to scrap some info about videogames in EuroGame!.  
This proyect was made because when I was coursing prolog I had to create a proyect with info about something of my interest, I choose videogames
and I didn't found any scrapper so I decided to create mine xd.

## How to install  
At the moment this scrapper just works with any Unix OS, Windows is not yet supported.  
In order to install you need to do 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/NexWan/euroscrapper
```
Go into the src folder and do 
```sh
python main.py
```
